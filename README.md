A small web app, using jqtouch & clojurscript.
Used to keep track of money spent by a group of people and tells you how to even out the costs amongst them:

- Alice spent $25 on beer
- Bob spent $20 on pizza
- Charlie spent $40 on gaz driving everybody to the party.

The app will tell you that Bob owes $8.33 to Charlie, and Alice owes $3.33 also to Charlie.
